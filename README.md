# Assignment 1 - Divya Kopalle

How long did the assignment take?
    This assignment took about 5/6 hours in total including set up and debugging, there was a alot of playing around and understanding the assignment environmemnt
What was most unclear
    What was most unclear was how the factor was manipulating the image, at first I thought I had to use the three variable constructor and maniupalte each z channel by the factor but then i realized using the one vairable constructor for the float image was much more efficient and did the same thing
